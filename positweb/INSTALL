====== Installation Info on POSIT ======

Things needed

Apache 2.0+ with mod_rewrite and mod_php5
MySQL 5.0+

Things to do

- Copy the config.sample.php file as config.php
- Create the username and password in the mysql database
- dump the file positweb.sql into the database you create

You need to have cache folder make writeable by the server
Two ways:
 chown www-data:www-data cache -R
 chmod 777 cache -R
I prefer the first one giving all write access is bad idea
if you want to change this, do it in controller/main.php
