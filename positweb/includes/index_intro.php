<h2>What is POSIT?</h2>
<p>
Portable Open Search and Identification Tool (POSIT) is a Humanitarian Free and Open Source 
Software project (HFOSS) to use the Google Android phone as a platform for mobile disaster 
management applications. POSIT (Portable Open Search and Identification Tool) is an extensible 
and configurable Android prototype currently running on the G1 phone provided by T-Mobile.  
It is configured to serve as a portable search and rescue tool, using the phone's GPS, camera, 
database, and touchscreen interface to collect and save data about disaster victims and transmit 
the data periodically to a remote server using either an Internet or cellular protocol. 
POSIT demonstrates that the free and open Android platform is an accessible platform for rapid 
application development of disaster management applications on mobile phones.
